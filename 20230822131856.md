## Make an unlisted playlist without an account

[source](https://www.labnol.org/internet/create-youtube-playlists/28827/)

By using a specific URL with comma-separated video IDs, you can make an unlisted playlist, like so:

`https://www.youtube.com/watch_videos?video_ids=id1,id2,id3...,idn`

## Link partway through a video

There are two ways to do this; provide either a timestamp in the format `YmXXs` or a number of seconds. Examples for both are provided:

`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=video_id&t=1m30s`

`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=video_id&t=90`
