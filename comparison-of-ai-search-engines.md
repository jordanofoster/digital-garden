# Usage of AI for search engines as an alternative to conventional search

Many exist, but I've found the following so far:

- [Phind](https://phind.com) - https://phind.com/search?q=%s
	- Appears to be trained for usage in answering technical/coding questions.
	- Has options for 'expert' (GPT4) and 'concise' answers; the latter are sometimes not concise.
		- Seems to struggle if you ask it questions that do not have direct answers and require a summarization...
- [Perplexity AI](https://perplexity.ai) - https://perplexity.ai/search?q=%s&focus=internet/scholar/news/reddit/wikipedia
	- Contains several 'search' options: Internet/Academic/News/YouTube/Reddit/Wikipedia.
	- Also seems to 'hard-code' search results so that they can be shared with others.
		- However, doesn't show sources at the side for clickability?
	- Very concise answers, seems to do well with coding problems also
		- Current preferred search engine.
