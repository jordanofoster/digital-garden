# Lists of rare or hard-to-find RSS feeds

Sometimes, a little bit of fiddling is required to get exactly what you want out of a website's RSS feeds, given that you aren't provided a direct link. Here are a few that I don't currently use but don't want to discard.

- [Shut Up & Sit Down](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com) provides a variety of RSS feeds for their own content.
  - Unfortunately, they do not provide a feed that *just* has their longform article-format reviews... [but *I* do](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/category/reviews/feed/).
  - In fact, you can do this for any 'list of items' type feed on their site (in the format `/category/reviews` by adding `/feed` on the end.
	- Here's one for their [video reviews](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos-category/reviews/feed/).
  - Combining the 'article' and 'video' review feeds provides a subjectively better way to peruse their reviews than their pre-baked 'games' feed since the site can actually be quite slow for me.
	- You miss out on non-review discussion of the game (such as in podcasts or *SUSX*), but I'm not mainly there for that content anyway. Some top 10 style lists sneak in since it's basically any 'video' content they tag as a review, but those are fine also.
