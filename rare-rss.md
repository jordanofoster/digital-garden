# Lists of rare or hard-to-find RSS feeds

Sometimes, a little bit of fiddling is required to get exactly what you want out of a website's RSS feeds, given that you aren't provided a direct link. Here are a few that I don't currently use but don't want to discard.

- [Shut Up & Sit Down](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com) provides a variety of RSS feeds for their own content.
  - Unfortunately, they do not provide a feed that *just* has their longform article-format reviews... [but *I* do](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/category/reviews/feed/).
